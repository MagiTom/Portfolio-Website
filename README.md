# MyPortfolio

This is my portfolio website, which I designed in Adobe XD and then made it by using Angular
framework version 12.0.5. It is a summary of my up-to-date work and the process of learning how to program. It is more
clear and more orderly than my other projects. The experience of writing apps and websites taught me
how to write a more friendly code.
In this project I used angular animations for the first time. Before that, I was using only css keyframes or
Anime.js. The website is responsive and written according to the mobile first standards.

## Demo

https://mag-porfolio.herokuapp.com/

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local disc. Then run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
